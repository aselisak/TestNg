TestNG
Is a testing tool that helps us to structure our test cases using different annotations

Benefits of TestNG
1.Reports
2.Annotation e.g @test, @before, @beforeclass
3.Parallel testing
4.batch execution
5.Assertionsâ€”> Hard Assertions, SoftAssertions
6.Data Parameterization

It can be integrated with cucumber, maven and selenium.

1.Annotations:
We do not need any main method

Annotation is a tag that provides additional information about class, interface or method in testNG
Annotation are used to keep the structure of the test cases
@Test
@BeforeMethod
@AfterMethod
@BeforeClass
@AfterClass

1.@Test
You should write your test cases under this annotation.
This is the main annotation
By default TestNG executes the methods in alphabetical order

2.@BeforeMethod
Runs every time before the @Test is executed
Also called precondition

3.@AfterMethod:
Runs after each test method
Also called post condition

before method is precondition that must run before every test case and post condition will run after the test case has ended

priority:
by default the priority is zero of all test cases
in order to give the priority order
use @Test(priority=1)

Enable:
@Test(enabled=True) by default run the cases
@Test(enabled=False) will not run the test cases that are set to False

DependsOn:
@Test(dependsOnMethods="method name")
will only run if the dependent method has passed successfully else it will be skipped

HardAssertions:
we have hardAssertions in TestNG
in order to use the assertion we use

Assert.assertionType()

1.Assert.AssertEquals(String1,String2);
it passes if String1 equals to String2
if fails if String1 equals to String2

2.Assert.AssertTrue(boolean Variable);
check the state of a boolean variable
it passes if the boolean is True
it fails if the boolean is False

In hard assertions if we have multiple assertions
as soon as one them fails it quites checking other assertions and declared the test case has failed


SoftAssertions:

soft assertion continue to check all the assertions regardless of the fact even if one or more assertions have failed,
which is not the scenario in case of HardAssertions (they stop execution when even one assertion fails.)

in order to use soft assertion
1.Declaration
SoftAssert soft = new SoftAssert();

2.soft.AssertEquals(String, String) instead of Assert.AssertEquals(String, String)
at the end you must do

3.soft.AssertAll().
after declaration when we use sof.assert it just checks

class 02
TestNg XML
<suite>
        <test>
        <classes>
           <class>
                <method>
               </method>
               </class>
             </classes>

             <packages>
          </package>
        </test>
</suite>

@BeforeClass
this annotation is used to execute the only once before the execution of the class
@AfterClass
this annotation is used to execute the only once after the execution of the class

@BeforeTest
this annotation is used to execute the method only once before the execution of the class

whenever we run by groups
the @beforeMethod and @afterMethod do nut run because they are not under the tag of groups

when we ran by method name
@beforeMethod and afterMethod
